- These are the famous stone walls, built by Koruda Kanbei during the Edo period of Japan.
- These walls were built using a technique called "Nozura-Sumi", which is a method of stacking rocks as they are instead of shaping them.
- These walls were also built during the reign of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, 
- whom Kanbei gifted the castle to as a base for his expedition to the Chugoku region.
Q All of this was built using recycled rocks, typically volcanic or sedimentary ones...

- Next, we're at Nishinomaru Bailey's Peony Garden.
- This was built for Princess Sen, Senhime, or Lady Sen.
- To the south is the "Hyakken-roka", which means "long connecting corridor", which was initially built as a defense mechanism for the west side.
- This is nearby the tower that Princess Sen spent her days in Himeji with her second husband, Honda Tadatoki.
- The flowers in the garden typically bloom in about April-

- Have you heard of the Shogun Slope? It's just northeast of here.
- It's called that because it was used in the ending of the television show "Aberenbo Shogun".
- The holes on the walls are shaped like triangles and rectangles so that defenders can shoot enemies.
- The holes are also wide inside but narrow outside, to give an extra advantage to defenders as it's harder to be shot at.
