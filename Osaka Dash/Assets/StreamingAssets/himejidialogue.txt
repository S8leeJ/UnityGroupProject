- These are the famous stone walls, built by Koruda Kanbei during the Edo period of Japan.
- These walls were built using a technique called "Nozura-Sumi", which is a method of stacking rocks as they are instead of shaping them.
- These walls were also built during the reign of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, 
- whom Kanbei gifted the castle to as a base for his expedition to the Chugoku region.

- To the south is the "Hyakken-roka", which means "long connecting corridor", which was initially built as a defense mechanism for the west side.
- This is nearby the tower that Princess Sen spent her days in Himeji with her second husband, Honda Tadatoki.
